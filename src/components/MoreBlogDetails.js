              The potential for edge intelligent solutions is huge. Edge AI
              applications vary from surveillance cameras with video analytics
              and smartwatches to autonomous vehicles and smart cities. Numerous
              enterprises across industries are beginning to show a significant
              adoption of edge devices with intelligent analysis to drive new
              levels of performance and productivity.

              Traditionally, data gathered at the edge is transmitted to the
              main server or a cloud for further processing and analysis. This
              process takes time and can be costly. Deploying edge AI for
              physical security helps to curb these issues as well as meet the
              need for real-time predictions. In a critical situation, the
              ability to detect, analyze and immediately respond to an emerging
              threat is of vital importance as it helps mitigate risks and
              prevent escalation of potentially dangerous scenarios. Letâ€™s
              explore how edge AI works and what makes it beneficial for
              organizations.
